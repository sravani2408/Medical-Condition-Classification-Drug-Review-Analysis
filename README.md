Analyzed drug reviews to classify medical conditions using NLP and ML.
- Processed text data by eliminating HTML, special characters, and stopwords. Applied lemmatization for normalization.
- Extracted features from cleaned text using TF-IDF vectorization. Created training and testing sets for model evaluation.
- Explored n-gram modeling using different ranges (bigrams, trigrams, and anagrams) for TF-IDF vectorization. Assessed model performance across various n-gram configurations.
- Identified influential features per condition using the Passive Aggressive Classifier.
- Suggested top drugs based on high-rated reviews for specific conditions.
